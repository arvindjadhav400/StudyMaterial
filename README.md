# StudyMaterial for to get started
1) Install nodejs from https://nodejs.org/en/
2) Intall git from https://git-scm.com/download/win
3) clone project of test folder from any git library like for the test folder command as follows
    git clone https://github.com/arvindjadhav400/test.git
4) we need server for any code to run so we have node js so we need to have instll js files for that from common source and is called as npm 
5) based on dependancy add in index.js and package json file https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p8RiJvxCRo
6) after doing local html files and js make sure it should run on "npm run start" command
7) commit the code to git for that command
        git commit -m "test for commit any words"
        git push
8) for deployment login to heroku
    https://dashboard.heroku.com/
9) go to the app or create new app and go to deploy and then link github repository where we commited code to the hroku
10) at the last ther is button deploy branch and then at the end there will be link where application is started
    if not started check on local by npm start it should work
        if still not make git clone again and do npm install and npm start may you missed some dependancy to rigister or missed any thing to commit to github.
        
        
        ENJOY
